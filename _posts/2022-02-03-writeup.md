/*
The solutions to this challenge belong to different levels :

Level 1 : an iterative algorithm which typically takes more than a second to
find a solution (for any given output). 

Most people stop here, which is fine, but if you want to go further, there is :

Level 2 : a non-iterative algorithm which typically takes less than a
millisecond to find a solution (for any given output).

Few people have reached this level. But if you want to beat it completely,
there's yet another castle...

Level 3 : an algorithm which can provide any of the 2^128 solutions (for any
given output).

Even fewer people have reached this final level. Congratulations to them!

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    u8 target[]="Hire me!!!!!!!!";
    u8 output[32];

    Forward(input,output,confusion,diffusion);

    return memcmp(output,target,16); // => contact jobs(at)nerd.nintendo.com
}

```

main takes a decided target string, in this case `"Hire me!!!!!!!!"`, it then creates an empty 32 byte array that will be filled by the Forward function.
lastly, it returns 0 iff the first 16 bytes of output after the call to forward are the same as target.

First things first, lets make `Forward` more readable:
we can replace `c[32]` with `input[]`, `d[32]` with `output[]`, `s[512]` with `confusion[]` and `p[32]` with `diffusion[]`.
 Furthermore, since all of them are global variables, we don't need to pass them as parameters for Forward.

lastly, lets look at `c[j]^=d[k]*((p[j]>>k)&1);` it multiplies d[k] by the k'th bit of p[j] which is the same as xoring if the k'th bit is set. Hence we get:

```c
void Forward(u8 output[32])
{
    for(u32 i=0;i<256;i++)
    {
        for(u8 j=0;j<32;j++)
        {
            output[j]=confusion[input[j]];
            input[j]=0;
        }

        for(u8 j=0;j<32;j++)
            for(u8 k=0;k<32;k++)
                if((diffusion[j] >> k) & 1)
                    input[j]^=output[k];
    }
    for(u8 i=0;i<16;i++)
        output[i]=confusion[input[i*2]]^confusion[input[i*2+1]+256];
}

```

Now the challenge seems more understandable - this is a keygen challenge. we need to figure out a way to reverse the Forward algorithm.
 Let's start at the end: 

 ```c
for(u8 i=0;i<16;i++)
    output[i]=confusion[input[i*2]]^confusion[input[i*2+1]+256];
 ```

it uses 2 values in input as indexes calculating a XOR operation which results in one byte in output.
since we start with output, this specifies the rules to use when generating a final input.

we can choose a random index between 0 and 255 for the first value in a pair, the second value is determined by XORing with `target[i]`.

However, since both bytes must be in confusion, the first in range [0, 255] and the second in range [256, 511], it is possible the second value won't be a valid option. (please note since each byte appears at most twice in confusion, every byte must appear in it due to the pigeonhole principle)  
In that case, we go again. after we are done with the first pair, we do the second one and so fourth.

the python code for this:

```python
def gen_candidate():

    indexes_in_confusion = gen_indexes_in_confusion() # a dictionary. keys=bytes, values=indexes of key in confusion (2 at most)

    candidate = bytearray()
    for i in range(16):

        while True:
            first_index = randint(0, 255)
            first_val = confusion[first_index]

            second_val = TARGET_STR[i]^first_val
            if second_val not in indexes_in_confusion:
                continue

            _, second_index = indexes_in_confusion[second_val]
            if second_index is None or second_index < 256:
                continue

            second_index -= 256

            candidate.append(first_index)
            candidate.append(second_index)
            break
    
    return candidate

```

Next, lets take a look at the middle part:

```c
for(u8 j=0;j<32;j++)
    for(u8 k=0;k<32;k++)
        if((diffusion[j] >> k) & 1)
            input[j]^=output[k];
```

if checks if the k'th bit is set in diffusion and only if it is it XOR's input[j] with output[k].  
When we go in reverse, we already know input[] and instead we try to figure out output.  

Can you recognize? take a closer look and think linear algebra.  
This is a system of linear equations! This means it can be represented using matrix algebra.

In this case, the rows of the matrix are the binary representation of the numbers in diffusion. In other words, each number in diffusion is translated into a row with 32 elements, all of which are binary (either 0 or 1)

A\*x = b is the same as TranfusionMatrix\*output = input

We can use Gaussian elimination to calculate Inverse(TranfusionMatrix) allowing us to reverse the middle stage entirely.  
(it goes without saying that the fact TranfusionMatrix is inversible isn't trivial, but nontheless is true in this case and can be confirmed by inversing using one of the many algorithms for that)

Since i couldn't find an easy way to perform gaussian elimination with XOR instead of addition using existing libaries, i just implemented my own version.  
you can find it in the repository for the challenge. This is what i considered to be most challenging programming-wise in this challenge.

lastly we come to the first part:

```c
for(u8 j=0;j<32;j++)
{
		output[j]=confusion[input[j]];
		input[j]=0;
}
```

This is what i would say is the trickiest part. This part performs substitution which means there isn't a one-to-one function allowing us to know input from output. Still, we can generate all possible `input[]` options and test for each one. The code to generate options:

```python
def gen_candidates_from_confusion_at_input(confusion_at_input):

    candidates = [[]]

    for c in confusion_at_input:

        if c not in confusion_dict:
            return []

        index1, index2 = confusion_dict[c]

        if index2 is None:
            for candidate in candidates:
                candidate.append(index1)
        
        else: # index 2 is not None
            new_candidates = []

            for candidate in candidates:
                clone = candidate.copy()
                candidate.append(index1)
                clone.append(index2)
                new_candidates.append(clone)

            candidates.extend(new_candidates)

    return candidates
```



Now that we have our candidates, we  use a recursive method for that, implemented in a way like DFS - we go in depth for each option until one proofs itself as a viable solution. if it is not a viable solution, for instance after reversing several iterations we find a byte which is nowhere in the first 256 indexes of confusion, we give up on this option and check the next one. The code in python:

```python
def reverse_iterations(candidate, remaining_iterations = 256):

    if remaining_iterations == 0:
        return candidate
    
    confusion_at_input = mult_inverse_and_vec(candidate)    
    new_candidates_list = gen_candidates_from_confusion_at_input(confusion_at_input)


    for new_candidate in new_candidates_list:
        result = reverse_iterations(new_candidate, remaining_iterations-1)
        if result is not None:
            return result

    return None
```

We run the code and find a solution!

## Final notes

This was probably the most enjoyable programming challenge i have solved thus far, mainly because i got to use Math i studied at university which i did not expect to ever use, still, a pleasant surprise :)

Please note, although reading the writeup may make this challenge seem easy, it is not that simple. realizing the system of equations at place and that it can be reversed using linear algebra is quite a tricky notion. Furthermore, realizing that some candidates may prove invalid after several iterations due to bad bytes not appearing in the first 256 bytes of confusion was especially tricky.
