# My github pages site 

Here i publish writeups for challegnes i thought were intresting enough. the writeups can be found in _posts and are written using markdown (usually raw markdown, sometimes however with jupyter-notebook downloaded as markdown)

The site is at: https://saardr.github.io/

The site was made using [minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) and [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
